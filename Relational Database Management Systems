Relational Database:
A relational database is a type of database. 
It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. 
Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables

Tables: Rows and Columns
Tables can have hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions of rows of data. These rows are often called records.
Tables can also have many columns of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name (say, age for example) and have a specific data type.

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database.
Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database.

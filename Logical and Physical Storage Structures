Oracle Database allocates logical space for all data in the database. 
The logical units of database space allocation are data blocks, extents, segments, and tablespaces. At a physical level, the data is stored in data files on disk.

Oracle Database must use logical space management to track and allocate the extents in a tablespace. 
When a database object requires an extent, the database must have a method of finding and providing it.
Similarly, when an object no longer requires an extent, the database must have a method of making the free extent available.

Oracle Database manages space within a tablespace based on the type that you create. You can create either of the following types of tablespaces:

Locally managed tablespaces (default)
The database uses bitmaps in the tablespaces themselves to manage extents. Thus, locally managed tablespaces have a part of the tablespace set aside for a bitmap. Within a tablespace, the database can manage segments with automatic segment space management (ASSM) or manual segment space management (MSSM).

Dictionary-managed tablespaces
The database uses the data dictionary to manage extents 
Oracle Database architecture
Oracle Database manages the storage of data, organizes it in a manner for easy retrieval, and provides access to data for multiple users. 


Physical vs. logical storage
Oracle database architecture depends upon two types of storage: physical and logical.
Physical (disk) storage contains all the files in the database. Logical storage structures, such as tablespaces, segments, extents, and blocks,
appear on the disk but are not part of the dataset.
Logical storage helps users locate specific data and improves the efficiency of the retrieval process, enabling
a modular data storage system in which capacity can be adjusted without affecting performance.

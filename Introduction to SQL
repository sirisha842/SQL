Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special purpose language for interacting with relational databases.
The beauty of SQL is that anyone working at a company that stores data in a relational database can use it.
It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables a user to create, read, update and delete relational databases and tables.

These SQL commands are mainly categorized into five categories as: 
DDL – Data Definition Language
DQL – Data Query Language
DML – Data Manipulation Language
DCL – Data Control Language
TCL – Transaction Control Language

Data Definition Language (DDL) : It is used to create and modify the structure of objects in a database using predefined commands and a specific syntax. 
These database objects include tables, sequences, locations, aliases, schemas and indexes.

Data Manipulation Language:
A DML (data manipulation language) refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add (insert), delete (delete), and alter (update) data in a database. 
It isis typically a sublanguage of a larger database language like SQL, with the DML containing some of the language's operators.

DQL (Data Query Language):
DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get 
some schema relation based onthe query passed to it.
We can define DQL as follows it is a component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database 
and imposing order upon it. It includes the SELECT statement.

DCL (Data Control Language): 
DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

TCL (Transaction Control Language): 
Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit.
Each transaction begins with a specific task and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully complete. 
If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails.

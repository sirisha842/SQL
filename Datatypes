SQL Data Types:
Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline
for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, 
and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

SQL Server Data Types

Text: An alphanumeric string of letters, numbers, and (in some cases) symbols. There are two types of text fields:
Standard or "small" text fields are used for very specific, statistical information that is entered into contact fields, account fields, or custom object records. 
Small text contact fields and account fields have a maximum of 100 characters, and small text custom object records have a maximum of 250 characters. 
If you are using a multi-select picklist with text fields, each field has a limit of 1000 characters.
Large text fields of any kind support up to 32,000 characters. 
These fields can be used to provide descriptions, extra context, or feedback, depending on the nature of the asset in which the field is placed.

String Data Types :
Data type     	Description     	                Max size	                Storage
char(n)     	Fixed width character string	    8,000 characters	           Defined width
varchar(n)	  Variable width character string	  8,000 characters	           2 bytes + number of chars
varchar(max)	Variable width character string 	1,073,741,824 characters	   2 bytes + number of chars
text	        Variable width character string	  2GB of text data	           4 bytes + number of chars
nchar	        Fixed width Unicode string	      4,000 characters	           Defined width x 2
nvarchar	    Variable width Unicode string    	4,000 characters	 
nvarchar(max)	Variable width Unicode string	    536,870,912 characters	 
ntext	Variable width Unicode string	                                        2GB of text data	 
binary(n)    	Fixed width binary string	          8,000 bytes	 
varbinary	      Variable width binary string	    8,000 bytes	 
varbinary(max)	Variable width binary string	                                  2GB	 
image	          Variable width binary string	                                  2GB



Numeric: Includes decimal numbers (up to four decimal points) and integer numbers (including negative values). 
The maximum length of a numeric value is 19 integer digits (15 before the decimal point and 4 digits after the decimal point). 
Text values such as "$" are no longer allowed in the field, but are now part of the format.

Date/time: A properly-formatted date and/or time in one of the formats allowed in your implementation of Eloqua. 
For example, you can use the MM/DD/YYYY format for dates (the North American format) or you may be set up to also allow DD/MM/YYYY, MMM-DD-YY, or MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS.
